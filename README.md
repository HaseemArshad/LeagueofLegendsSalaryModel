# Overview of our League of Legends Salary Model:
This is a predictive salary model for the esport League of Legends, which is a popular online multiplayer game that is enjoyed by millions globally. 
We aim to solve an issue in the industry of esports and gaming in general: transparency. We aim to show transparency, specifically in the salaries of players and the elements that are linked to players having higher salaries than others.
As a result, we have created a synthetic database using data collection and data cleaning ideology to filter out our data. Afterward, we incorporate an SQLite3 Database, which we use for feature engineering, feature scaling, and database overall querying to find trends/patterns in our 30,0000+ dataset.  We move forward with showing specific correlation relationships between salary and other fields. Lastly, we end with a Linear Regression model, which is used to train our dataset and predict players' salaries based on our training of the model on key patterns.
